# The plans.yaml and plans/ directory are optional. 
# In cf marketplace, each service has a set of plans that developers can provision. A plan is a template for service 
#    instances. For example, different plans might represent a large or a small instance of a database. 
# NOTE: Refer to the "(Optional) Define Plans Configuration" section in the "Preparing a Service Offering" document 
#     at https://docs.pivotal.io/ksm if you need further information.
